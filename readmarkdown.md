## Mastering Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight programming language.  It is used on the GitHub platform.  Markdown utilizes special characters to control design elements such as bold, italic, headings, and to incorporate photos and links.

Additionally, markdown can be used to order websites with ordered lists, unordered lists and blockquotes.

In order to create tables an arrangement of hyphens in the first row and vertical pipes dividing the content in the first row and all subsequent rows.  The result would look like this:

First Column | Second Column | Third Column | Fourth Column
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
Cell A1      | Cell A2       | Cell A3      | Cell A4
Cell B1      | Cell B2       | Cell B3      | Cell B4
Cell C1      | Cell C2       | Cell C3      | Cell C4

A feature of Markdown is automatic linking.  A URL such as http://www.google.com/ automatically becomes a clickable link.

It is also useful for developers who would like to connect with potential employers.  GitHub pages can be utilized without developers needing to set up databases or servers.
