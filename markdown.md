### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is a deliberate paradigm in which a person views their ability to learn in a positive manner.  Specifically, the mindset is active rather than reactive.  A growth mindset does not view cognitive ability as a fixed asset but as an expandable one. A growth mindset is not a rosy-view that anything is possible with a positive attitude but rather a recognition that with a deliberate attitude, an effort-ethic and perserverence one can reach a fuller potential.

### Three Reminders of How I Can Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset:
- I need to remember that when I struggle to learn new things, the act of struggling is a direct result of actively learning.  It is uncomfortable but it is a positive thing.
- I need to make it my practice to set ambitious goals.
- I need to remember to take time to reflect; remembering the positive parts of the learning process as well as the difficult parts.

My name is Robert Zimmerman.  I have the sweetest Bernese Mountain Dog.  She is three years old but she believes she is 8 weeks old.  I am husband to a beautiful wife who is, fortunately for me, incredibly patient.  I served in the United States Marine Corps.
