## Git Intro

### Version Control

- Version control is a system whereby Git allows users to revisit their projects by saving and storing those projects intermittenly throughout the build cycle.  This process allows users to correct mistakes by calling on earlier versions of those projects.
- It also allows for the collaboration of many developers simultaneously on one project while managing developers programming rights.

### The ACP Process

In storing code files in GitHub while also working on them on your local laptop it is important to ensure synchronicity between the versions.  This is accomplished by executing the ACP process through your computer's local terminal.  The ACP, or Add, Commit, Push flow is accomplished by executing the following series:

- **Add:** git add nameoffile
- **Commit:** git commit -m"your message here"

> **Note:** It is important to explain that the meaning of the message should convey the "why" behind the changes that we made by the developer prior to the commitment and reconciliation of the code.

- **Push:** git push origin main
