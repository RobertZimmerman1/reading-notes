## Read 12: Chart.js, Canvas

---

### Chart.js

- Chart.js is a JavaScript plug in that is used to create charts and graphs.
- The script tag for Chart.js `<script src='Chart.min.js'></script>`
- Drawing a Line Chart: - To create a Canvas Element this must be added to the HTML:

```html
<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
```

- Then this must be added to the foot of the `<body>` element:

```html
<script>
  var buyers = document.getElementById("buyers").getContext("2d");
  new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
</script>
```

- Inside the same `<script>` tag the following will add the data to the chart:

```js
var buyerData = {
  labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June"],
  datasets: [
    {
      fillColor: "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
      strokeColor: "#ACC26D",
      pointColor: "#fff",
      pointStrokeColor: "#9DB86D",
      data: [203, 156, 99, 251, 305, 247],
    },
  ],
};
```

### Canvas

- The `<canvas>` element is similar to an `<img>` element. The differences being the `<canvas>` element does not have either 'src' or 'alt' attributes, but rather takes only two attributes being 'width' and 'height'. Additionally, the `<canvas>` element is not self-closing but rather requires a tag.
- 'ID' and 'class' attributes may be assigned to the `<canvas>` tag.
- `<canvas>` differs from `<img>` elements in that it is easier to define fallback content for `<canvas>` which is displayed by older browsers that don't support it.
- The `<canvas>` element creates a fixed size drawing surface on which the content to be rendered is shown and manipulated.
