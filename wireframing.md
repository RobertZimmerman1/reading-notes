## Wire Framing

### An Introduction to Wire Framing

Wire framing is one method of planning the layout of a website at the beginning of the design process.  Often, wire framing will begin with a simple sketch of the page or pages so that the designer can begin to think about the layout of elements and how the website should function.  At this point feedback from the client can be useful and may avoid excessive re-design later on in the build of the site.

Ideally, the wire framing sketch should take no more than 5 - 10 minutes for most websites.

**Common Elements in Wire Framing**

## Mozilla HTML Basics

HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is a language used to define the content of websites.  It is characterized by the use of tags to differentiate between types of elements, includes classes and id's used in targeting and is organized in a nested structure.

**Examples of Types of Tags**
- `<!DOCTYPE>`
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<meta>`
- `<body>`
- `<section>`
- `<ul>`

Though HTML can handle some very basic visual formatting (bold, italic, header standards, etc.) it is not principaly concerned with the style of the website.  For that, it is used in conjunction with cascading style sheets, or CSS.

## Semantics

"Semantics" means the meaning of a snippet of code.  HTML rather than CSS is more closely aligned with the idea of semantics as HTML defines the content of a website rather than the style.
