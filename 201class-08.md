### CSS Layout

- Key Concepts of Positioning Elements:
  - Block Level: Block level elements start on a new line.
  - Inline: Inline elements exist in a continuous fashion between the adjacent texts.
  - Positioning: Rules can be applied to elements to make their position _relative,_ _absolute,_ or _fixed_. These rules determine the way that the element moves with respect to the viewer and the other elements on the page.
  - `<div>`: Div elements are used to group together sections of a page.
  - Containing Elements:
    - Block level elements within other block level elements are said to be within that parent element's container. Examples of types of typically grouped elements include the header, the footer, cards with in the body etc.
  - Block Level Elements Relative to One Another:
    - **Static:** Static elements are arranged one on top of the other. The block takes up the full width of the display.
    - **Relative:** Relative positioning is considered and can be adjusted relative to the parent element of the block.
    - **Absolute:** Absolute positioning takes the block out of the page. The other elements ignore it completely and behave as if the block isn't there.
    - **Fixed:** In fixed position the block stays in the same place in the viewport regardless of how the user navigates the page.
    - **Overlapping:** With relative, fixed or absolute positioning, block level elements are allowed to overlap. The order in which they overlap is defined by giving the element a CSS characteristic of z-index.
