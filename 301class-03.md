### Reading Docs, Lists and Keys

What does .map() return?

- .map() will return an array of an equal length to the array that the method searches through. .map() takes all of the items in the original array and performs a transformative function on each of the items.

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

- The syntax to loop through an array with the .map() method would be the array to be investigated, followed by the .map() command followed by a function.

Each list item needs a unique \_\_\_\_.

- Each list item need a unique key. It is important in tracking .map() method changes.

What is the purpose of a key?

- Keys are used to help React track changes.

### The Spread Operator

What is the spread operator?

- The spread operator is a method used to manipulate objects and arrays. Some of the transformations the spread operator can perform include: adding, removing items, combining arrays, combining object and distributing arrays over functions.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

- Add items to arrays.
- Combining arrays.
- Combining objects.
- Iterating functions through arrays.

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

- If a piece of code had two arrays, one for cats and one for dogs, the spread operator could be utilized to combine the two arrays into a new array, perhaps an array for animals. In this way the operator is able to manipulate data.

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

let friend = {
name: jane
};

let gender = {
gender: female
}

let girlfriend = {
...friend,
...gender
};

console.log(girlfriend);

girlfriend is:
name: jane,
gender: female
