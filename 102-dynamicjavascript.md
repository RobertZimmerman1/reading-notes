## Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

---

### Overview

- JavaScript is a programming language which controls the functionality of websites and applications.  If HTML defines the content of a website and CSS defines the style, JavaScript can be said to define the way that content is changed according to the way that the user interacts with the site. 

### Primitives

- **Strings:** Strings are used for storing and manipulating text.  They are stored within quotes and their length is the number of characters within those quotes to include spaces and special characters. For example: 'This is a string.'
- **Numbers:** Numbers used to store numbers. For example: 0 or 1 or 2 or 300.
- **Arrays:** Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.  For example: [Red, Blue, Green, Indigo, Black].
- **Objects:** Objects are used to store variable with multiple properties.  For example: If we had a variable that might be a person, that person might have many properties associated to him, like height, weight, hair color, etc.  In referencing an Object one can also reference that Objects properties.  The syntax of an Object looks like this: var person = {height: 6'0", weight: 195, hair color: 'blond'}
- **Booleans:** Booleans is a variable that can have one of two values: true or false.  In programming it is very useful to be able to evaluate some variables or expressions that only evaluate to true or false.

### Functions and Other Operations

- Functions: A function is a block of code that is designed to perform a specific task.  Often a particular task must be performed again and again.  This is where functions are particularly useful. Writing functions in code does not execute the function.  The function must be called elsewhere. Functions may be declared, expressed or written as an arrow.
    - This is an example of the syntax of a declared function: function countApples(){};
- Loops: Loops are a block of code that can be used when that code needs to be run over and over again with different values.
    - This is an example of the syntax of a loop: for (let index = 0; index < 100; index++){ console.log(index);}
    - Inside the parenthesis are the instructions for the loop.  Let index = 0 means the first time the loop is run consider the index to be 0.  Index > 100 means if the index is less than 100, perform the code within the curly braces.  Index++ means if the index was less than 100 and the code within the curly braces was run, increase the value of index by 1 and run the code again.
- If Statements: If statements are blocks of code that check some other variable or block of code and if some condition is met execute a nested block of code within the if statement.
