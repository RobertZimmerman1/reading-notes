## Read 06: JS Object Literals; the DOM

---

### Object Literals

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. _~(JavaScript and JQuery pp. 100)_

| let hotel = {       |
| ------------------- |
| name: Del Coronado; |
| rooms: 400;         |
| booked: 350;        |
| beachAccess: true;  |

|roomTypes: [single, double, suite;]
}

- The above is an example of the object 'hotel'. The object has properties in key-value pairs that are specific and available by reference to the object. For example, the key 'name' has the value 'Del Coronado'.

### Accessing an Object with Dot Notation

- The properties of a defined object may be referenced by targeting the object's properties with dot notation. For example, the following would store the string 'Del Coronado' in the variable 'beachHouse'.
  - `let beachHouse = hotel.name`

### Document Object Model

- The DOM has 4 types of nodes:

  - Document
  - Element
  - Attribute
  - text

- Element Selectors:

  - Tag
  - ID
  - Class

- Developer Tools:
  - Console: The console is a tool that developers can use to make sure that their script is working as expected. Messages may be logged to the console to check specifically, at certain points, that the code is doing what is expected. Additionally, the console will return error messages specifying the type and line where is an error is encountered.
