### Object Literals

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. _~(JavaScript and JQuery pp. 100)_

| let hotel = {       |
| ------------------- |
| name: Del Coronado; |
| rooms: 400;         |
| booked: 350;        |
| beachAccess: true;  |

|roomTypes: [single, double, suite;]
}

- The above is an example of the object 'hotel'. The object has properties in key-value pairs that are specific and available by reference to the object. For example, the key 'name' has the value 'Del Coronado'.

### Accessing an Object with Dot Notation

- The properties of a defined object may be referenced by targeting the object's properties with dot notation. For example, the following would store the string 'Del Coronado' in the variable 'beachHouse'.
  - `let beachHouse = hotel.name`
