## Read 03: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and CSS Box Model

---

### Lists

- Numbered Lists: Numbered lists are numbered. Said another way, they are ordered.
  - `<ol> => <li>`
- Bulleted Lists: Bulleted list are not numbered. Said another way, they are unordered.
  - `<ul> => <li>`
- Definition Lists: Definition lists are arranged to organize definitions.
  - `<dl> Definition List => <dt> Definition Term => <dd> Definition Definition`

### Boxes

- Boxes can have the following attributes:
  - width
  - height
  - overflow: hidden or scroll
  - border: The width, style and color of the border
  - margin: The space between the box and the next element
  - padding: The space between the content and the border

### Decisions and Loops

- If, Else Statements:
  - An 'if, else statement' evaluates if a condition is true. If the condition evaluates to true a code-block is run. If the condition does not evaluate to true, an 'else' statement is evaluated. If the 'else' statement evaluates to true, then another code-block is run.
- Switch Statements:
  - A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
    `~JavaScript and JQuery pp. 164`
- Loops:
  - Loops run a code block again and again.
  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i == true; i++) {
    some code would run here...;
  }
  ```
