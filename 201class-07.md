## Read 07: Object Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Tables

- Tables represent information in a grid format. They are oriented according to two axis, the body of which contains cells.
- Table Structure:
  - `<table>`: The element used to create a table.
  - `<tr>`: Table row. Each row starts with table row.
  - `<td>`: Table data. These represent the cells contained within the table row.
  - `<th>`: Table head. Each column starts with a table head.
  - `<colspan>`: The colspan attribute determines how many columns a table cell should run across.
  - `<thead>`: The table head. Titles should be placed within the table head.

### Functions, Methods & Objects

- The 'new' keyword is used to create a blank object. Properties and methods can later be added to the blank object.
  - let car = new object ();
- This is the syntax for adding properties to the previously created blank object:
  - car.name = 'ford';
  - car.color = 'black';
  - car.year = 2020;
  - car.manual = true;
- Object Method:

```js
  let area = {
    width:300px,
    height:250px,
    getArea: function() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }};
```

- The function that runs within this object has access to the properties assigned to the variable area. So, writing 'this.width' is the same as writing 'area.width'.

### Arrays as Objects

- Arrays are also objects. However, arrays have a special property. In addition to the properties being described as key-value pairs, the properties also have position within the array. This position can be looked up.
