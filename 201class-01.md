## Basics of HTML, CSS and JS

---

### HTML

- Headings, Paragraphs and Typical Types of Markup

  - `<h1>` through `<h6>` denotes standard formatted headings for ease of use
  - `<p>` paragraph
  - `<b>` bold
  - `<i>` italics
  - `<sup>` superscript
  - `<sub>` subscript
  - `<br>` linebreak
  - `<hr />` horizontal break <i>(for a break between sections of a page)</i>

- Structural and Semantic Markup
  - Semantic Markup: Semantic markup are text elements which do not necessarily render to the page. Rather they are intended to provide extra information to the page. Examples of uses for semantic markup include screen readers and search engine optimizers.

### JS

- Scripts are step by step instructions that the computer performs.
- Some basic types of scripts in JS include evaluations, if statements, for statements, while statements, loop statements and functions.
- If Statements: If statements evaluate whether a condition or series of condition evaluate to true. If the condition is true, a code block is run.
- For Loops: For loops are used to rerun code over and over again, each time with a different value. For loops are used when the number of times the loop should be run is known.
- While Loops: While loops are similar to for loops except that they are used when the number of times the loop will run is unknown.
- Functions: Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are reusable and can take variables with different values. Functions are not automatically run but must be invoked.
