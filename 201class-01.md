- Headings, Paragraphs and Typical Types of Markup

  - `<h1>` through `<h6>` denotes standard formatted headings for ease of use
  - `<p>` paragraph
  - `<b>` bold
  - `<i>` italics
  - `<sup>` superscript
  - `<sub>` subscript
  - `<br>` linebreak
  - `<hr />` horizontal break <i>(for a break between sections of a page)</i>

- Structural and Semantic Markup
  - Semantic Markup: Semantic markup are text elements which do not necessarily render to the page. Rather they are intended to provide extra information to the page. Examples of uses for semantic markup include screen readers and search engine optimizers.
