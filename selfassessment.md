## Top Three Strengths
- **Adaptability:** My training and experience as a United States Marine helped me to cultivate an attitude of flexibility and adaptability.  Our unit's motto was "adapt and overcome".  The conditions of our work were especially fluid and unpredictable however that didn't change the fact that at the end of the day the job still needed to get done.  I feel very fortunate to have had that experience and strive to carry a resilient mindset forward.
- Ambition and Initiative: I am not shy when it comes to identifying a thing that needs to get done and acting to do it.  This may be a double-edged sword in that I have been known to occasionally overstep my authority but in general I choose to err on the side of too much action, rather than not enough.
- Ownership: I view my work as an extension of my person and therefore take pride in it.  I take mediocre craftsmanship and failed outcomes personally.


## Top Three Areas for Growth
- Incremental Delivery: I am averse to turning in parts of a project before the project's completion as a whole, preferring rather to complete the project in drafts and iterating revisions.  I understand this will not be possible as a software developer.  Additionally, I understand without incremental deliverable I'm likely robbing the project of early feedback and collaboration. 
- Networking: I prefer to be introverted 90% of the time.  I understand theoretically just how vital networking is to success but I really don't want to put the work in.  This is one of my biggest shortcomings and I know that I'm going to have to work to change my mindset.
- Tool Proficiency: I have almost no experience or training in software development.  I am unfamiliar with the tools and best-practices.  I hope to make good progress with this proficiency over the next four months during my training.
