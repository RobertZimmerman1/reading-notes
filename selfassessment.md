## Top Three Strengths
- Adaptability: My training and experience as a United States Marine helped me to cultivate an attitude of flexibility and adaptability.  Our unit's motto was "adapt and overcome".  The conditions of our work were especially fluid and unpredictable however that didn't change the fact that at the end of the day the job still needed to get done.  I feel very fortunate to have had that experience and strive to carry a resilient mindset forward.
- Ambition and Initiative: I am not shy when it comes to identifying a thing that needs to get done and acting to do it.  This may be a double-edged sword in that I have been known to occasionally overstep my authority but in general I choose to err on the side of too much action, rather than not enough.
- Ownership: I view my work as an extension of my person and therefore take pride in it.  I take mediocre craftsmanship and faiiled outcomes personally.
