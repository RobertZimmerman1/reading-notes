## Read 10: JS Debugging

---

### Debugging

- Debugging is the process of finding errors.

- The console is a useful tool in debugging. It allows you to check parts of your code so that you can narrow down areas of your code that are working as expected and areas that are not. When the console returns an error message it usually does so with a reference to the line of code and the type of error that is occurring.

- 7 Types of Errors in JavaScript:

  1. Error: The is a generic error. All of the other errors are subsets of this error.
  2. Syntax Error: Proper syntactic rules have not been followed in the code.
  3. Reference Error: The code has tried to reference a variable that has either not been defined, or is not available at the scope level.
  4. Type Error: The code has tried to reference a data type that does not work with code and the data type cannot be coerced into behaving as expected.
  5. Range Error: Number data types are not within a specified range.
  6. URI Error: Encode URI and decode URI methods are not being used correctly.
  7. Eval Error: The eval() function has been used incorrectly.

- Try, Catch and Finally Statements:

  ```js
  try {
    //try to execute this snippet of code
  } catch (exception) {
    //if there is an exception, run this code
  } finally {
    //this always gets executed
  }
  ```
