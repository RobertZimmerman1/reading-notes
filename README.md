### About Me:

My name is Robert Zimmerman. I have the sweetest Bernese Mountain Dog. She is three years old but she believes she is 8 weeks old. I am husband to a beautiful wife who is, fortunately for me, incredibly patient. I served in the United States Marine Corps. I aspire to a career change into software development and I am very excited for the journey.
