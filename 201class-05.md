### Images

- Common uses for links

  - Sources for Stock Photos:
    - www.istockphoto.com
    - www.gettyimages.com
    - www.veer.com
    - www.sxc.com
    - www.photolia.com
  - Photos may be stored in a folder belonging to your site, or they may be found on the web and referenced by the image's address.

  - Image Attributes:

    - src: This tells the browser where the image can be found.
    - alt: This displays some text describing the image if the image fails to display. It is also used by screen readers and search engine optimizers.
    - title: This provides a description of the image. Typically when the user hovers the mouse over the image the title text is displayed.
    - height: This forces the height of the image to a set size. Unless told otherwise the image will scale the width to proportionally match.
    - width: This is the same as height, except applied to the width.

  - Image Syntax: -`<img src="http://sourceURLOfImage.com alt="Image Description" title="Image Title"/>`

### Color

- Ways to Apply Color:
  - RGB Values: Color may selected in CSS by defining how much red, green and blue to apply. i.e. (86, 40, 100).
  - HEX Codes Color may be selected with a six digit hexadecimal code which defines how much red, green and blue the color should possess. i.e. #ee3e80
  - Color Names: Color may be selected according to 147 common and predefined colors which are already named. i.e. Forest Green
  - Manual Color Picker: Color may be altered in the CSS code by selecting the color swatch next to a color that has already been entered in code. That color may then be adjusted according to a color wheel. Additionally, in the wheel opacity may also be adjusted.
