## Operators and Loops

---

### The Operators

- **Unary Operator:** A unary operator takes a single operand, either before or after the operator.  An example of this is found in iterating "for" loops where a variable such as "index" is being told to iterate by some value.
    - ( index++) is a single operand.
- **Binary Operator:**
- **Ternary Operator:** The ternary operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The first operand (condition) is evaluated.  If the first operand is evaluated to truthy, then the second truthy operand is returned.  If not, then the falsy operand is returned.
    - First Operand ? Truthy Operand : Falsy Operand
    - condition ? value1 : value2
