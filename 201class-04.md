### CSS Layout

- Key Concepts of Positioning Elements:
  - Block Level: Block level elements start on a new line.
  - Inline: Inline elements exist in a continuous fashion between the adjacent texts.
  - Positioning: Rules can be applied to elements to make their position _relative,_ _absolute,_ or _fixed_. These rules determine the way that the element moves with respect to the viewer and the other elements on the page.
  - `<div>`: Div elements are used to group together sections of a page.
